  abstract = {Consider a Möbius strip with n chosen points on its boundary. A triangulation is a maximal collection of arcs among these points and cuts the strip into triangles and quasi-triangles. We prove that the number of all triangulations that one can obtain from a Möbius strip with n chosen points on its boundary is given by 4n−1 + (2n−2n−1). We then connect our finding with the number of clusters in the quasi-cluster algebra arising from the Möbius strip.},
