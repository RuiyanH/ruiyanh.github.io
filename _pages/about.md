I’m a Yale senior (Data Science & Environmental Studies) aiming for SWE/frontend roles. I design and ship user-facing features with React, TypeScript, Next.js, Tailwind, Node, and Python—often for data-heavy, climate-focused projects. Recent work includes an interactive geophysical viz for carbon sequestration, a green-finance screening dashboard, and tooling around computer-vision workflows for snow-leopard ID. I care about accessibility (WCAG), performance (Core Web Vitals), testing (Jest/Cypress), and clean design systems. Earlier, I co-founded a bilingual coding bootcamp for middle-school girls in rural China—experience that sharpened my product sense and communication.
