Hi, I’m Ruiyan—a data scientist and visual storyteller drawn to messy, meaningful problems at the intersection of climate, computation, and AI. My recent work spans from building McKinsey-style cost curves for commercial cooling systems to identifying snow leopards with computer vision—applying machine learning, spatial analysis, and statistical modeling to real-world complexity. I ship with Python/SQL, PyTorch, and geospatial tooling—and I care about making results intuitive and usable.
Lately, I’ve been exploring how AI agents can turn fuzzy trip ideas into bookable plans—structured tool-calls, a lightweight constraint solver for cost/time/CO₂, and one-tap calendar holds.


Off-screen I collect languages (Mandarin/English/Spanish/German), train karate (brown belt, 3rd Kyu), and roam around the world with my well-loved Sony α7 (11 years old) and a Ricoh GR IIIx. I’m a mild plant hoarder, happiest backpacking, climbing, and chasing ocean swells and starry skies—then home to two orange cats and a border collie.
