Hi, I’m Ruiyan--climate-focused data scientist and visual designer who likes code that feels as considered as the typography. I analyze, model, and visualize climate data, and I prototype front-end experiences when the story needs interactivity. I’m comfortable building in React/TypeScript and Next.js, stitching data with Python/SQL, and handling the unglamorous bits—APIs, data plumbing, auth, testing, and deploys (Vercel/AWS). Recent work: an interactive geophysical viz for carbon sequestration, a green-finance screening dashboard, and computer-vision workflows for snow-leopard ID.

Off-screen I collect languages (Mandarin/English/Spanish/German), train karate (brown belt, 3rd Kyu), and roam around the world with my well-loved Sony α7 (11 years old) and a Ricoh GR IIIx. I’m a mild plant hoarder, happiest backpacking, climbing, and chasing ocean swells and starry skies—then home to two cats and a border collie.
